SIL Verification:

The Safety Integrity Level (SIL) of an entire Safety Instrumented Function (SIF)
must be verified via a calculation of PFH/PF Da, considering redundant
architectures, proof test interval, proof test effectiveness, any automatic
diagnostics, average repair time and the specific failure rates of all products
included in the SIF. Each element must be checked to assure compliance with
minimum hardware fault tolerance (HFT) requirements.

The following documents are a mandatory part of certification:
Assessment Report: FLO 13/03-024 R006 V3R2 (or later)
Safety Manual: FLOSILAMAXR&P Rev 2 (or later)
