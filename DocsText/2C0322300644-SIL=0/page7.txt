ASC 2112125 C001
Systematic Capability: SC 3 (SIL 3 Capable)

Random Capability: Type A, Route 2, Device

PFH/PFDa,, and Architecture Constraints
must be verified for each application

Systematic Capability :

These products have met manufacturer design process requirements of
Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 3. These are intended to achieve sufficient
integrity against systematic errors of design by the manufacturer.

A Safety Instrumented Function (SIF) designed with these products must not
be used at a SIL level higher than stated.

Random Capability:

The SIL limit imposed by the Architectural Constraints must be met for each
element. This device meets exida criteria for Route 2,,.

SIL Verification:
The Safety Integrity Level (SIL) of an entire Safety Instrumented Function (SIF)
must be verified via a calculation of PFH/PF Dag considering redundant
architectures, proof test interval, proof test effectiveness, any automatic
diagnostics, average repair time and the specific failure rates of all products
included in the SIF. Each element must be checked to assure compliance with
minimum hardware fault tolerance (HFT) requirements.

The following documents are a mandatory part of certification:
Assessment Report: ASC 21/12-125 R001 V2R1 (or later)
Safety Manual: V9629 Rev JC (or later) Page 2 of 2
