Origin of values

The stated values are the results of an FMEDA. It was verified by qualification test of the safety
function under critical conditions and the analysis of field feedback of the last eight years. Random and
systematic failures which are the responsibility of the manufacturer were examined.

Systematic Capability

The development and manufacturing process and the functional safety management applied by the
manufacturer in the relevant lifecycle phases of the product have been audited and assessed as
suitable for the manufacturing of products for use in applications with a maximum Safety Integrity

Level of 3 (SC 3).

Periodic Tests and Maintenance

The given values require periodic tests and maintenance as described in the Installation, Operating

and Maintenance Manual and the Safety Manual.

The operator is responsible for the consideration of specific external conditions (e.g. ensuring of
required quality of media, max. temperature, time of impact), and adequate test cycles.
