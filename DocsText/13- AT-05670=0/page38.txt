Special Instructions >

Do not duplicate data in the address map. There should be only one
address defined for analyzer 1, application 1, Stream 1, result 1.
(This differs from the HCIH address map.)

The address map must contain an ANALYZER STATUS for every
transmitting analyzer/application.

The address map must contain a RESULT for every transmitted
component (with EUHI if required).

lfthe bad value is > O there will be the normal process of setting
values “bad.” Otherwise, the component values will be stored as is.

Messages from the host must be alternated until version 3.11.

EUHI values must be >= 1.0.

Addresses in the 40000s, 20000s, and 70000s all map to the same
registers. Do not overlap the addresses. i.e., do not use 40001 and
70001 in the same map.

Starting with Version 3.1, itis acceptable to request a range of ad-
dresses, some of which do not exist. Bad values will be returned for
the undefined addresses. The first address in the range must exist in
the address map.

Starting with Version 3.1, RS-485 multidrop is operational.
