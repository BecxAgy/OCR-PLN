Example 2

1x% of applications for application status

2 x% of results for results

1 for host alive (useless)

1 for database change flag

1x% of applications for looking at longest cycle length
1 x % of streams for readme flags

1x % of streams for forcing streams

1 x of streams for enable/disable stream

1 x% applications for determining if a stream is running dedicated
1 x % streams for determining next stream

1x É streams for euhi change flags + 1 x É applications
2 x % applications for calibration control

1 x% applications for run/hold

Customer has 30 applications, 50 streams, 300 results
Customer wants no host control, merely unscaled results.

Map needs : 30 for application status
300 for results
330 addresses

Customer has 150 applications, 400 streams, 600 scaled results

Customer wants readme flags, enable/disable stream, calibration control,
application run/hold.

Map needs: 150 for application status
1200 for results/euhi
400 for readme flags
400 for stream enable, disable
300 for calibration control
- 150 for run/hold
2600 addresses
