MODBUS |Integer | For digital: | A pair of addresses are re-
Address 00001 to quired for each 32-bit floating
9999 point number. All addresses
10001 to must be unique within each of
19999 the four tables (0, 1, 3, and 4).
The first digit of the address
Forinteger | specifies the table. Addresses
or float: in the 20000s, 40000s and
20001 to 70000s share the same mem-
29999 ory locations. These address
30001 to ranges allow the host to format
39999 the date into swapped 32-bit,
40001 to 16-bit integer, or 32-bit float,
49999 respectively.
