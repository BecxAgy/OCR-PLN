Function 16 â€” Preset Multiple Registers

Master Command The master sends a command writing the values to a string of analog
outputs (table 4), specifying the starting address, the number of analog
values, and the 16-bit values. The values are sent with the more signifi-
cant byte before the less significant byte.

For example, the master might set the values of the 2 registers 40136
and 40137 to 10 (0x000A) and 258 (0x0102) respectively in slave 17:

Function Byte
Slavef Code Data Start Quantity Count Word O Word 1
High Low High Low High Low High Low
11 10 00 87 00 02 04 00 OA 01 02

Preset Multiple Registers Command

Slave Response If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will send a
response with its identity, the function code, the starting address, and the
number of analogs (quantity) whose values were set:

Slavef Function Code Data Start Quantity
High Low High Low
11 10 00 87 00 02

Preset Multiple Registers Response

Error Response Similar to Function Code 05, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the register's address is outside the configured
range of table 4 (analog outputs) or if the combination of starting address
and quantity results in an address outside of the configured range.

A FAILURE IN ASSOCIATED DEVICE error response will be sent if an
internal error prevented the command from being carried out.

Normally there would not be an ILLEGAL DATA VALUE response be-
cause all values should be acceptable. The function code in the error
response will be 144 (0x90) indicating that the error occurred on a com-
mand with Function Code 16.
