MODBUS Data Types

Basic Data Types

Digital Values

The MODBUS protocol has two basic data types, digital and analog.
Digital values are either O (zero) or 1 (one). Analog values are usually
16-bit 2's complement integers, giving a range from —-32768 to 32767.
The MODBUS protocol also uses 16-bit positive integers with a range of
O to 65535 (for example, MODBUS addresses). Digital values are often
referred to as coils. Analog values and other 16-bit values are often re-
ferred to as registers.

MODBUS messages that transmit a string of digital values pack these
into a sequence of bytes. The first 8 digitals are packed into the first byte,
the next 8 digitals are packed into the second byte, and so on. Digital
values are packed into a byte using the least significant available bit. The
value of the first digital value is given by the least significant bit of the
first byte. If there are not enough digital values to fill the last data byte,
the unused bits of that byte will be in the most significant bit positions
and have a value of O.

For an example of packing bits into bytes, assume the following se-
quence of 19 digital values will be packed into 3 consecutive bytes:
0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0, and 1,
Then: the first eight bits (0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1) would be packed into the first
byte which would have the value 0xF4 (11110100), the next eight bits
(1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0) would be packed into the second byte which would have
the value 0x41 (01000001), and the last three bits (1,0,1) would be
packed into the third byte which would have the value 0x05 (00000101)
because the most significant 5 bits of the third byte would be set to zero:

Data Byte O Data Byte 1 Data Byte 2
7/6/5/4/3/2/1/0/7/6/5/4/3/2/1/0/7/6/5/4/3/2/1]/0

Bit-Packing Digitals Into Bytes (bit positions are shown)

One MODBUS function sets the value of a single digital (Function 05 —
Force Single Coil). This particular function represents the value of ON by
OxFFOO (65023 decimal) and the value of OFF by 0x0000 (zero).

Within a MODBUS message, the values of 16-bit quantities are sent with
the more significant byte transmitted before the less significant byte.
Note that this is opposite of the way MODBUS RTU transmits the CRC-
16 checksum.
