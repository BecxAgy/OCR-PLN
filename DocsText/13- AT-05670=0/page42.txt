MODBUS Primer, Continued

RTU vs. ASCII MODBUS RTU is more efficient than MODBUS ASCII, but has stringent
timing restrictions that are difficult to comply with when implemented on a
multitasking computer, especially using languages such as FORTRAN.
For this reason, many MODBUS interfaces either deviates from the
MODICON specifications regarding MODBUS RTU timeouts or else im-
plement the MODBUS ASCII format.

Communication In both message formats, the message will be discarded if one of these
Errors communication errors is detected:

* Received checksum differs from the checksum computed for the
message;

* | Length of received message differs from length determined for
that function;

* lfaslave receives a message with a function code of O (zero) or
between 128 and 255;

* | Ifthe master receives a message with a function code of 0;
* Character parity error if either odd or even parity is configured.

As a diagnostic tool, MODBUS devices usually maintain message count-
ers that record the number of messages received and the number dis-
carded due to communication errors.

If a slave detects a communication error in a command, the slave dis-
cards the message and does not respond to the master. If the master
detects a communication error in a response, the master discards the
message and retries sending the command. The master will also retry
sending a command if an expected response is not received within a
configured timeout interval. Master devices may be configured to alert an
operator or execute a diagnostic sequence if sending a command fails
after a number of retries.
