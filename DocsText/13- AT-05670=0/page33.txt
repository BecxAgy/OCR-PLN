Floating Point Formats

IEEE 32-bit Float The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has published a

Format standard for floating point formats on computers. The 32-bit version will
be supported by the Maxum Modbus. The 32-bit values will be packed
into pairs of consecutive Modbus registers (16-bit words). The most sig-
nificant 16 of the 32 bits will be placed into the first register (lower ad-
dress) and the less significant 16 bits will be placed into the second reg-
ister (higher address). The most significant bit of the 32 bits will be the
most significant bit of the first register. The least significant bit of the 32
bits will be the least significant bit of the second register. The host com-
puter (Modbus master) must extract the 32-bit floating point value from
the registers in the Modbus message. 32-bit floating point values may be
mixed with 16-bit values in the same Modbus message. The Maxum
Modbus Address Map defines which Modbus registers hold which type of
data. The Maxum Modbus supports two floating point formats, one is the
standard (data type R), as described below, and the other is the same
format with the words swapped (data type Q).

NOTE: sending 32-bit IEEE floats using pairs of Modbus registers has
become fairly common.

The most significant bit of the IEEE 32-bit float is the sign bit, O for a
positive number and 1 for a negative number. The next 8 bits are the
exponent. If the exponent is O (zero), the mantissa represents either zero
or a special type of value called Not A Number (NAN) indicating values
that cannot be properly represented in the format. NAN numbers are a
special case that should not occur in the Maxum system. If the exponent,
mantissa, and sign bit are all zero, the value is zero. If the exponent is
not zero, the exponent represents a power of two with a bias of 127 and
the mantissa represents the fractional part of a value between 1.0 inclu-
sive and 2.0 exclusive. If the exponent is not zero, the value is given as:

Value = (-1)S!SN * (2.0)EXPONENT-127) * (4,0 + (MANTISSA / 8388608))

For example, the Master reads two floating point values from the regis-
ters 48601 through 48604, where the slave is identified as slave 65
(0x41). Translating this into a Modbus command, this would be a request
to read 4 registers starting at offset 8600 in table 4 of slave 65:
