Host / Analyzer Communications, Continued

Readable from Host Result values (Value type: RESULT)
Computer Valid Addresses: 20001-49999, 70001-79999

Expressed as a fraction of full scale (data type S) or as a 32-bit float
(data type R). Designated for transmission by the Maxum analyzer from
the Maxum's result table or ftom the Optichrom Advance analyzer. A
“bad value” is used, when defined in the map, when a condition on the
analyzer suggests that the values are not current or good. These condi-
tions are:

e the result exceeds the EUHI
e the EUHI has changed

e analyzer status is < 500 (in fault alarm, out of service, or application
time limit has expired)

e the stream is disabled.
EUHI values (Value type: EUHI) Valid Addresses: 30001-49999

This is the full scale value for each scaled result. It is set for each trans-
mitted result in the Maxum's result table. The default value is 100. Itis
sent to the Host as a 16-bit floating point number, as in the HCI-H. The
value is useful to the host to verify the full scale value used. Additionally,
the EUHI can be set by the Host to force synchronization and override
any EUHI set manually on the Maxum. EUHI values must be >= 1.0.

Analyzer/Application status (Value type: ANALYZERSTATUS)
Valid Addresses: 30001-49999

Each stream transmits the application status at the end of cycle. The
status values can range from O to 1000, as follows:

1000 normal, error free operation

9ss Optichrom Advance warning alarm on stream ss

7ss auto cal running on stream ss

6ss manual cal running on stream ss

5ss Optichrom Advance change test exceeded on stream ss
4ss Optichrom Advance database change on stream ss

3ss Optichrom Advance excessive rate of change test failed on
stream ss

2ss Optichrom Advance minimum rate of change test failed on
stream ss

100 application has fault alarm this cycle
50 application is out of service, disabled, or in hold
0 application is not transmitting results (timed out)
