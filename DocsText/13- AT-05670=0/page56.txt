Function 04 — Read Input Registers

Master Command

Slave Response

Error Response

The master sends a command requesting the values of a number of in-
put registers (table 3), specifying the initial address to read and the num-
ber of locations to read.

For example, the master might request a read of the register 30009 from
slave 17. Translating the values into hexadecimal, this is a request that
slave 0x11 read 0x0001 analogs starting at address 0x0008 (corre-
sponds to table offset 0009 of table 3):

Slavef Function Code Data Start Quantity
High Low High Low
11 04 00 08 00 01

Read Input Registers Command

If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will re-
spond with its identifier, the function code, a count specifying the number
of data bytes required for the analogs, and the string of data bytes. For
example:

Slavef Function Code Byte Count Word O
High Low
11 03 02 00 00

Read Input Registers Response

In this example, register 30009 has the value zero (0x0000).

Similar to Function Code 01, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the starting address or combination of starting ad-
dress and number of analogs exceeds the configured range of table 3
(analog inputs).

An ILLEGAL DATA VALUE error response will be sent if the number of
registers exceeds 127, the limit that can be packed into 254 data bytes
for a response.

Note: some devices limit the response length to 250 data bytes (125
registers). However, the function code in the error response will be 132
(0x84), indicating that the error occurred on a command with Function
Code 04.
