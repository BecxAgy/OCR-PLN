MODBUS Functions

Function Codes

MODICON has defined many MODBUS Function Codes, most of which
are specialized for PLC configuration and some are only used with spe-
cific models of PLC's. Most vendors only implement a subset of the
MODBUS functions.

The following functions are almost always supported:

Function 01 Read Coil Status reads a string of digital outputs
(table 0)

Function 02 Read Input Status reads a string of digital inputs
(table 1)

Function 03 Read Holding Registers reads a string of analog outputs
(table 4)

Function 04 Read Input Registers reads a string of analog inputs
(table 3)

Usually Supported Functions

The following functions are almost as common:

Function 05 Force Single Coil writes a value to a single digital
output (table 0)
Function 06 Preset Single Register writes a value to a single analog

output (table 4)

Very Common Functions

The following functions are also very common:

Function 15 Force Multiple Coils writes values to a string of digital
outputs (table 0)

Function 16 Preset Multiple Regis- writes values to a string of analog
ters outputs (table 4)

Common Functions

Note: At least one of Function 05 and Function 15 will be implemented.
Usually both are. At least one of Function 06 and Function 16 will be im-
plemented. Usually both are.

Less common functions are:

Function 08 Loopback Diagnostic diagnostic test message sent to
Test test communications

Function 11 Fetch Event Counter check slave's communications
Communications counter

Less Common Functions

The other MODBUS functions tend to be specific to models of
MODICON PLC's and are not described here.
