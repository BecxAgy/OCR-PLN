Function 08 â€” Loopback Diagnostics Test

Master Command The master sends the Loopback Diagnostics Test command to test com-
munications with a slave device. A 2-byte diagnostic code tells the slave
what action is required. MODICON has specified a number of diagnostic
codes and reserves some additional codes for proprietary use. Most of
the diagnostic codes tell the slave to return a value from an internal
communications event counter (e.g., Diagnostic Code 12 requests the
Checksum Error Count). The 2-byte data code is followed by a two byte
(16-bit) data value.

Diagnostic Codes Diagnostic Code | Action of MODBUS Slave Device
0 Respond by echoing command
1 Reinitialize MODBUS interface
10 Clear event counters (reset to zero)
11 Respond with the number of received messages (bus

message events)

12 Respond with the number of received checksum er-
rors (checksum error events)

13 Respond with the number of error responses sent
(exception events)

14 Respond with the number of responses sent (re-
sponse events)

15 Respond with the number of commands not re-
sponded to (nonresponse events)

16 Respond with the number of NAK responses from at-
tached devices (NAK events)

17 Respond with the number of busy responses from at-
tached devices (busy events)

Function 08 - Loopback Diagnotic Test Diagnostic Codes

Diagnostic Codes 16 and 17, NAK, and busy event counters respectively
are a diagnostic for MODBUS slave interfaces that forward values to at-
tached devices perhaps over a proprietary network.

Full definitions of these codes are shown on the next page.
