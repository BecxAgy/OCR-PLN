Result Values

Scaled Results

Floating Point

Result values (any component or other value stored in the Maxum's re-
sult table) can be sent to the Host as either:

* scaled integers, or

* 32-bit floating point numbers.

Scaled results are stored in a single register as:

scaled result = Round(ScaleFactor * Maxum ResultValue / EUHI)

EUHI must be >= 1.0.

A floating point result is stored in a pair of registers. Only the first register
in the pair is defined in the address map. The floating point format for
MODBUS addresses in the 70000s is the 754 standard IEEE 32-bit float.
The format for addresses in the 20000s is IEEE 32-bit float with the
words swapped. The format for addresses in the 40000s is either
swapped or unswapped based on the data type setting (R or Q).

Floating point values can be transmitted ffom Advance Optichrom by
using a fractional full scale of 1.0 and an euhi of 1.0.
