Function 15 â€” Force Multiple Coils

Master Command

Slave Response

Error Response

The master sends a command writing the values to a string of digital out-
puts (table 0), specifying the starting address, the number of digitals, and
the values. The values are packed into bytes. The first byte contains the
values of the first eight digitals, the second byte contains the values of
the next eight digitals, and so on. The values are packed into the bytes,
beginning with the least significant bit of a byte and finishing with the
most significant bit of the byte. If there are not enough digitals to fully use
all of the bits of the last data byte, the unused bits should be set to zero.
There should be at least one digital value in the last data byte.

For example, the master might set the values of the 10 coils 00014
through 00023, turning ON (one) coils 00014, 00016, 00017, 00020, and
00021 while turning OFF (zero) coils 00015, 00018, 00019, 00022, and
00023:

Force Multiple Coils Command

If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will send a
response with its identity, the function code, the starting address, and the
number of digitals (quantity) whose values were set:

Slavef Function Code Data Start Quantity
High Low High Low
11 OF 00 13 00 OA

Force Multiple Coils Response

Similar to Function Code 05, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the register's address is outside the configured
range of table O (digital outputs) or if the combination of starting address
and quantity results in an address outside of the configured range.

A FAILURE IN ASSOCIATED DEVICE error response will be sent if an
internal error prevented the command from being carried out.

Normally there would not be an ILLEGAL DATA VALUE response be-
cause all values should be acceptable. The function code in the error
response will be 143 (0x8F) indicating that the error occurred on a com-
mand with Function Code 15.
