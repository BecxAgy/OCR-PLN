Function 02 — Read Input Status, Continued

Error Response Similar to a Function Code 01, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the starting address or combination of starting ad-
dress and number of digitals exceeds the configured range of table 1
(digital inputs).

An ILLEGAL DATA VALUE error response will be sent if the number of
digitals exceeds 2040, the limit that can be packed into 255 data bytes
for a response.

Note: some devices will limit the response length to 250 data bytes
(2000 digitals). However, the function code in the error response, will be
130 (0x82) indicating that the error occurred on a command with Func-
tion Code 02.
