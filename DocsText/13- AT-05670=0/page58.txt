Function 05 — Force Single Coil, Continued

Error Response Similar to Function Code 01, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the coil's address is outside the configured range of
table O (digital outputs).

An ILLEGAL DATA VALUE error response will be sent if the digital value
specified is neither OxFFOO (ON) nor 0x0000 (OFF). However, the func-
tion code in the error response will be 133 (0x85) indicating that the error
occurred on a command with Function Code 05.
