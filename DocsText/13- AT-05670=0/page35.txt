EUHI 16 Bit format

The Optichrom Advance systems HOST Computer Communications In-
terface — HIWAY (HCI-H) used 16-bit integers to represent the values
from analyzer data as scaled fractions of the maximum expected value.
The maximum expected value is called the Engineering Unit High
(EUHI). The content of the 16-bit integer word is given by:

Scaled Result = Round ( ScaleFactor * Result value/ EUHI )

For example, if the scaling factor is 9999 and the current value is 35.0%
of an expected maximum of 50.0%, 9999 * 35.0 / 50.0 = 6999.3 which
would be rounded to 6999 (nearest integer) and stored in the 16-bit
word.

The ScaleFactor is normally 999, 4095, 9999, or 65534 but can be con-
figured to any other value between 1 and 65534. A ScaleFactor of 65535
is not allowed because 65535 is the BAD VALUE (bad quality) indicator.
The ScaleFactor must be configured in both the host system and the
Maxum system.

The host system obtains the current value by making this conversion:
ResultValue = EUHI * Scaled Result/ ScaleFactor

The EUHI is represented using a special 16-bit floating point format de-
rived from the IEEE 32-bit floating point format. The sign bit is still the
significant bit (O for positive, 1 for negative). A 6-bit exponent (bias 31)
follows the sign bit. The mantissa occupies the 9 least significant bits.
The value 0x0000 represents 0.0. An exponent value of zero with a non-
zero mantissa is similar to the Not A Number (NAN) values of the IEEE
32-bit floating point format. Otherwise, the exponent should have a value
between 1 and 62, representing powers of 2 between —30 and 31 inclu-
sive. An exponent value of 63 is reserved as an indicator of a 'Bad
Value”. The EUHI format is only used to represent EUHI values (maxi-
mum values):

EUHI = (-1)SSN « (2.0)EXPONENT-3 . (14,0 + (MANTISSA /512))
