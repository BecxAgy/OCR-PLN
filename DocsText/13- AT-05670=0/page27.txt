Address Map and
MODBUS Driver

Once the address map has been loaded onto the NAU, it may be viewed
and edited with System Manager/System Tables/MODBUS addmap or
MMI/Menu/Setup/Other Devices/MODBUS. Starting with Version 3.1, a
MODBUS Address Map may be fully edited in place. Use System Man-
ger to add, delete, and modify table entries in the Modbus addmap or
Modbus addmap result tables. Similar functions are available through
the Maxum MMI. Since the MODBUS address is the primary key of the
table, it cannot be modified, only deleted and replaced with a new entry.

The value attribute can be changed for testing. It contains the pre-scaled
version of scaled results and character representations of Boolean val-
ues (True or False).

The MODBUS addmap table acts as data collector for the Maxum and
Optichrom analyzers and the NAU's MODBUS driver. The MODBUS
driver has its own tables and memory. MODBUS communication occurs
between the driver tables and the host computer. These tables are not
viewable.
