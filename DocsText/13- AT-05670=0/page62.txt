Function 08 â€” Loopback Diagnostics Test, Continued

Diagnostic Codes 11
through 17

Error Response

Error Example 1

Diagnostic Codes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 are useful to allow a
host computer system (MODBUS master) to track communication statis-
tics on MODBUS slaves. The slaves respond with the values of event
counters.

Note: For Diagnostic Codes 10 through 17, the master should send a
data value of O (zero). Unless there is reason to do otherwise, the slave
device should ignore the data value (i.e., accept every data value) for
these diagnostic codes. For Diagnostic Codes 11 through 17, the slave
should respond with the value of the specified event counter. For Diag-
nostic Code 10, the slave should respond by echoing the command
(similar to the response for Diagnostic Code 0).

The only error that should occur is that a command with an unsupported
diagnostic code is sent. If the slave does not recognize the diagnostic
code, it should send an ILLEGAL DATA VALUE error response (see
Function Code 01 on page 45) with the Function Code set to 136 (0x88)
to indicate that the error occurred on a command with Function Code 08.

The master sends Diagnostic Code O with data value 42295 (0xA537) to
slave 17:

Slavef Function Code Diagnostic Code Data Value
High Low High Low
11 08 00 00 As 37

Loopback Test Diagnostic Code O Command

The slave will echo the command as a response:

Slavef Function Code Diagnostic Code | Data Value
High Low High Low
11 08 00 00 As 37

Loopback Test Diagnostic Code O Response
