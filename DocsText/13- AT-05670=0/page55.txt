Function 03 — Read Output Registers

Master Command

Slave Response

Error Response

The master sends a command requesting the values of a number of out-
put registers (table 4), specifying the initial address to read and the num-
ber of locations to read. For example, the master might request a read of
the 3 registers 40108 through 40110 from slave 17. Translating the val-
ues into hexadecimal, this is a request that slave 0x11 read 0x0003 ana-
ogs starting at address 0x006B (corresponds to table offset 0108 of ta-
ble 4):

Slavef Function Data Start Quantity
Code
High Low High Low
11 03 00 6B 00 03

Read Output Registers Command

If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will re-
spond with its identifier, the function code, a count specifying the number
of data bytes required for the analogs, and the string of data bytes. For
example:

Slave Function Byte
Eid Code Count Word O Word 1 Word 2

High Low High Low High Low
11 03 06 02 2B 00 00 00 64

Read Output Registers Response

In this example, registers 40108, 40109, and 40110 have the values 555
(0x022B), O (0x0000), and 100 (0x0064) respectively.

Similar to Function Code 01, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the starting address or combination of starting ad-
dress and number of analogs exceeds the configured range of analog
outputs (table 4).

An ILLEGAL DATA VALUE error response will be sent if the number of
registers exceeds 127 which is the limit that can be packed into 254 data
bytes for a response.

Note: some devices limit the response length to 250 data bytes (125
registers). However, the function code in the error response, will be 131
(0x83), indicating that the error occurred on a command with Function
Code 03.
