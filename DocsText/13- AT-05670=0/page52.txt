Function 01 — Read Coil Status, Continued

Possible Errors Possible errors that could occur are:

* The specified starting address is outside of the configured range
for table 0.

*. The combination of specified starting address and number of
digitals (quantity) would result in an address outside of the con-
figured range for table 0.

*. The specified number of digitals (quantity) is too large to fit into a
response. (A response can hold a maximum of 255 data bytes or
2040 digitals.)

Error Response Some devices limit the response length to 250 data bytes (2000 digitals).
If one of the first two errors occurs, an error response will be sent indicat-
ing that there is an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS. If the third error occurs,
an error response will be sent indicating that there is an ILLEGAL DATA
VALUE.

Using the example on page 45, slave 17 would respond to a command
which had an illegal address or an illegal combination of address and
number of digitals (quantity) with:

Slavef Function Code Error Code
11 81 02
ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS Error Response

Slave 17 would respond to a command specifying more than the allow-
able number of digitals (quantity) with:

Slavef Function Code Error Code
11 81 03
ILLEGAL DATA VALUE Error Response
