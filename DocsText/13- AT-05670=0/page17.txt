Readme flags (Value-TYPE: RDME) Valid Addresses: 0001-19999

This status flag can be defined for each analyzer/application/stream. Itis
set when the Maxum transmits results for a stream. The flag tells the
Host that there is new result data available. For versions before 3.11, the
flag automatically resets to zero after being read by the Host after 3 sec-
onds. These flags are stored in blocks of 1000 (1-1000, 1001-2000....).
When the host reads a flag in any certain block, all the flags in that block
are reset. The customer must be sure to read all rdme flags in a block in
a single message. Starting with version 3.11, the flag is reset after 20
seconds, regardless of host read. Each flag is reset independently. The
20-second default may be changed by setting the write offset value in
the Modbus addmap table.

DIREAD flags (Value-TYPE: DIREAD) Valid Addresses: 0001-19999

This flag can be defined for each Application DI that is defined in the
NAU's application 999. It is polled according to the Application DI setup.
The value in the result field designates the ID from the APPDI table.

DOREAD flags (Value-TYPE: DOREAD) Valid Addresses: 0001-
19999

This flag can be defined for each Application DO that is defined in the
NAU's application 999. It is polled according to the Application DO setup.
The value in the result field designates the ID from the APPDO table.

Database change flags (Value type: DCHG)
Valid Addresses: 0001-9999

This flag can be defined with or without analyzer/application/stream and
is set when the scale factor changes. The flag is not reset when read by
the Host. If defined for stream 0, it is a summary flag for all streams. If
stream O entry is set to 0, the flag will set all stream DCHG flags for the
application to O.

EUHI change flags (Value type: ECHG)
Valid Addresses: 0001-9999

This flag can be defined for each analyzer/application/stream and is set
when the EUHI is changed from the Maxum analyzer or from the Host.
The flag is reset, after 3 seconds, when read by the Host. If defined for
stream 0, itis a summary flag for all streams in the application. If stream
O entry is set to 0, the flag will set all stream ECHG flags for the applica-
tion to O.
