Function 05 â€” Force Single Coil

Master Command

Slave Response

Possible Error

The master sends a command writing the value of one output digital (ta-
ble 0), specifying the digital's address and the value to write. For exam-
ple, the master might request that slave 17 turn ON coil 00173. Translat-
ing the values into hexadecimal, this is a request that slave 0x11 write
OxFFOO to the coil at Ox00AC (corresponds to table offset 0173 of table
0):

Slavef Function Code Data Start Digital Value
High Low High Low
11 05 00 AC FF 00

Force Single Coil Command

If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will echo
the command as a response:

Slavef Function Code Data Start Digital Value
High Low High Low
11 05 00 AC FF 00

Force Single Coil Response

A possible error that might occur is that, although the address and data
value are valid, there is some internal error that prevents the digital value
from being written to the specified digital. For instance, the value may be
on another device connected over an internal network. If the other device
is offline or has security features, which can block writing to that device's
digital, this would cause a FAILURE IN ASSOCIATED DEVICE error
response.

For example, if slave 17 had not been able to carry out the command
because of an internal system problem, the response would have been:
