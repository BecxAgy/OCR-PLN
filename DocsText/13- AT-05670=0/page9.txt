Figure 1: Operation

This section provides an overview of the Maxum MODBUS operation.

The following steps are illustrated in Figure 1.

The Maxum units send sql commands or Optichrom Advance
units send Advance Data Hiway messages to the NAU database
at the end of a cycle or after a manual transmit.

The NAU updates the MODBUS addmap table. The correct ad-
dress is identified and updated with the value received from the
analyzer. Identification is based on the value type, aniz, applica-
tion, stream, and result.

The MODBUS Addmap table sends the value to the MODBUS
Driver.

The Host sends a message to the MODBUS Driver (messages
must be alternating in version 3.0 and 3.1)

The MODBUS Driver processes a read request and returns a
message to the host or sends the value to the modbus addmap
table.

The MODBUS addmap table determines the correct message to
send to a specific Maxum or Optichrom Advance unit based on
the address value type, anlz, application, stream, and result.
