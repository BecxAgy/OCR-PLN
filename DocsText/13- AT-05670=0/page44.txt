MODBUS Primer, Continued

Character
Transmission

MODBUS protocol uses normal RS-232C, RS-422 (not supported in the

Maxum), and RS-485 asynchronous character transmission. A start bit is
sent before the data bits, then the data bits are transmitted with the least
significant bit first, then an optional parity bit may be sent, and finally one
or two stop bits are sent.

In MODBUS RTU, the binary values of the message and checksum are
transmitted as characters. The checksum requires two bytes, which are
transmitted with less significant byte first, immediately after the last byte
of the message is transmitted. Characters must be transmitted as 8 data
bits. Character parity can be odd, even, or none. Either 1 or 2 stop bits
can be used.

In MODBUS RTU, a pause is inserted between messages to indicate the
start and end of a message. MODICON's MODBUS specification re-
quires a pause equal to or greater than the time required to transmit 3.5
characters at the configured baud rate. Shorter pauses are accepted
between characters in the same message. However, many MODBUS
RTU interfaces are implemented on multiprocessing computers and are
unable to detect such a small time interval, especially at higher baud
rates. For these systems, a larger pause is specified (for example, mini-
mum of 500ms inserted between consecutive messages).

The following table assumes: 8-bit data, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no par-
ity.
