Function 01 — Read Coil Status

Master Command The master sends a command requesting the values of a number of digi-
tal outputs (table 0), specifying the initial address to read and the number
of locations to read. For example, the master might request a read of the
37 coils 00020 through 00056 from slave 17. Translating the values into
hexadecimal, this is a request that slave 0x11 read 0x0025 digitals start-
ing at address 0x0013 (corresponds to table offset 0020 of table 0):

Slave * | Function Code Data Start Quantity
High Low High Low
11 01 00 13 00 25

Read Coil Status Command

Slave Response If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will re-
spond with its identifier, the function code, a count specifying the number
of data bytes required to pack the digitals, and the string of data bytes.

For example:
Func- Data Data Data Data Data
tion Byte Byte Byte Byte Byte Byte
Slave & Code Count (o) 1 2 3 4
1 01 05 cD 6B B2 0E 1B

Read Coil Status Response

In this example,

0xCD (11001101) indicates that coils 00020, 00022, 00023, 00026,
and 00027 are on.

0x6B (01101011) indicates that coils 00028, 00029, 00031, 00033,
and 00034 are on.

0xB2 (10110010) indicates that coils 00037, 00040, 00041, and
00043 are on.

0x0E (00001110) indicates that coils 00045, 00046, and 00047 are
on.

0x1B (00011011) indicates that coils 00052, 00053, 00055, and
00056 are on.

All of the other coils are off (value of zero).

Note: the three most significant bits of data byte 4 (fifth byte) are all un-
used and are therefore set to zero.
