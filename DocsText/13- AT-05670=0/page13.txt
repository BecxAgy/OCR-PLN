Status Information

Maxum Alarms

NAU Alarms

Each Maxum or Optichrom Advance analyzer transmits status informa-
tion at the end of the application cycle, along with the results. This infor-
mation is made available to the Host to ascertain the following:

e whether the application is in normal state, reporting data on schedule

e whether the application is calibrating, in hold, out of service, or has
not reported data on schedule

e whether the application has an error in the current cycle

e whether the application is operating with a forced always stream

e the enable/disable state of every stream in an application

e the current and next stream to be analyzed

e whether specific database or EUHI values have changed

Maxum alarms are defined as any alarms that may occur on the Maxum
analyzers. Most alarms that are associated with MODBUS communica-

tions will appear on the Network Access Unit (NAU).
