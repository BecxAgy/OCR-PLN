EUHI change (Value type: EUHI) Valid Addresses: 40001-49999

The EUHI value for any result can be set by the Host in 16-bit floating
point format. See the section on the EUHI format, page 29. Version 3.0
requires that EUHI values to be greater that 1.0.

Set clock (Value types: SCMIN, SCSEC, SCHR, SCDAY, SCMON,
SCYEAR) Valid Addresses: 40001-49999

By writing to the appropriate locations, the Host can set the date and
time of day on the Advance Network Access Unit (NAU).

lfthe NAU has designated another system as its time server, this has no
long term effect and will be overwritten by the time server. If there is no
time server for the NAU, this date and time will be allowed to remain but
will have no effect on the Maxum analyzers. In order for the date and
time to be sent to the Maxum analyzers, each Maxum analyzer will have
to have its time server set to the NAU's IP address.

DOset flags (Value type: DOSET)
Valid Addresses: 0001-9999

This flag can be defined for each analyzer/application/appdo and is set
by the host.

Alarm Clear flags (Value type: CLEARALARM)
Valid Addresses: 0001-9999

This flag can be defined for each analyzer, analyzer/application, and
analyzer/application/stream. The Maxum analyzer will clear all alarms for
the specified analyzer, application, or stream. This flag is not operational
for Advance Optichrom. Note that clearing alarms operates under the
same constraints as clearing the alarms directly on the Maxum. If stream
or application alarms are cleared, record of them is still kept by the appli-
cation and stream until a cycle without alarms completes.

Program run (Value type: PROGRAMRUN)
Valid Addresses: 40001-49999

Registers can be defined for each analyzer/application/stream. The
Maxum analyzer runs the event number that is indicated in the register
for the designated stream.
