MODBUS Data Types, Continued

MODICON Types In some of the MODICON programming languages, data is viewed as
being one of seven types:

Type O digital output (can be read and written)

Type 1 digital input (can only be read)

Type 2 digital value representing internal PLC status (exception)
Type 3 analog input (can only be read)

Type 4 analog output (can be read or written)

Type 5 analog value representing internal PLC value (event)
Type 6 file of 16-bit registers

In MODBUS terminology, types 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 are general-purpose, but
type 6 is implemented less frequently than types 0, 1, 3, and 4. Types 2
and 5 are not referred too directly. The type 2 and type 5 data varies be-
tween PLC models and can be accessed only through MODBUS func-
tions that are often specific to certain PLC models.

Although the MODBUS standard, defined by MODICON, does not spec-
ify how to send values other than digitals or 16-bit 2's complement inte-
gers, a frequent practice is to use the MODBUS protocol to other 16-bit
values or to send 32-bit and 64-bit values as pairs and quadruples of
registers. For 32-bit and 64-bit values, the most significant 16-bit portion
is sent as the first register and the least significant 16-bit portion is sent
as the last register. 32-bit IEEE floating point format values are the most
common deviation from the MODICON standard but sometimes the val-
ues of 32-bit integers and 64-bit IEEE floats are transmitted this way.

The MODBUS data model views each type of data as belonging to a
separate data table. The conventional notation for addresses specifies
which table and the offset within the table. The original ranges of the four
main data types are:

00001 to 09999 for digital outputs (read and write) meaning table O
with offsets 1 to 9999

10001 to 19999 for digital inputs (read only) meaning table 1 with
ofífsets 1 to 9999

30001 to 39999 for analog inputs (read only) meaning table 3 with
ofífsets 1 to 9999

40001 to 49999 for analog outputs (read and write) meaning table 4
with offsets 1 to 9999

Extended addresses may be supported in the future.
