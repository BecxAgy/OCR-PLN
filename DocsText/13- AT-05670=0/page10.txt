Serial
Communication

To configure hardware, have:

e | Maxum and Optichrom Advance analyzers and an Advance Network
Access Unit (NAU) attached to the same ethernet or Advance Data-
NET network. Small systems can allow the Maxum GC to do its own
MODBUS communications.

e NAU with 32-MB dynamic RAM and 8-MB battery backed up RAM.
e Host computer, setup to be a MODBUS master using MODBUS RTU

messages, connected to the NAU using the NAU's RS-232 or RS-
485 serial ports.

To set up serial communication:

Using Advance System Manager, enter a value in the modbus setting
attribute of the System Control table:

Y:a,b,c,d where

Y = serial port address (1 for the RS-232, 2 for RS-485) for SAM use
“COM 1º

a = baud rate (50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400)

b = parity (e, o orn)
c = data bits (8 only)
d = stop bits

default: 1:19200,n,8,1

These settings can be changed at any time prior to or during MODBUS
communication.

Note: For version 3.0 and 3.1, when configuring the host to send
MODBUS messages, messages must be alternated, i.e., the NAU will
discard “duplicate” messages unless a different message intervenes.
This is no longer required for 3.11.
