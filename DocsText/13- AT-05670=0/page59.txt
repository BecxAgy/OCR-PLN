Function 06 â€” Preset Single Register

Master Command

Slave Response

Error Response

The master sends a command writing the value of one output analog
(table 4), specifying the analog's address and the value to write. For ex-
ample, the master might request that slave 17 write the value 926 to reg-
ister 40136. Translating the values into hexadecimal, this is a request
that slave 0x11 write 0x039E to the register at 0x0087 (corresponds to
table offset 0136 of table 4):

Slavef Function Code Data Start Analog Value
High Low High Low
11 06 00 87 03 9E

Preset Single Register Command

If the slave can process the command without error, the slave will echo
the command as a response:

Slavef Function Code Data Start Analog Value
High Low High Low
11 06 00 87 03 9E

Preset Single Register Response

Similar to Function Code 05, an ILLEGAL DATA ADDRESS error re-
sponse will be sent if the register's address is outside the configured
range of table 4 (analog outputs).

A FAILURE IN ASSOCIATED DEVICE error response will be sent if an
internal error prevented the command from being carried out.

Normally there would not be an ILLEGAL DATA VALUE response be-
cause all values should be acceptable. The function code in the error
response will be 134 (0x86) indicating that the error occurred on a com-
mand with Function Code 06.
