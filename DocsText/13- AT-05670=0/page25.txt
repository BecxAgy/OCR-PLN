There are two special entries in the address map that set the “bad value”
and the scale factor. The scale factor will be used to calculate all scaled
values (data type S) in the address map. These can be results, cy-

cle length, and analyzer status. The “bad value” is used when certain
conditions exist, as in the HCI-H. If the “bad value” is set to zero, no “bad

value” processing is done.
