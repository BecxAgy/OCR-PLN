MODBUS Functions, Continued

Error Responses If a slave receives a command with the slave's identifier and with a func-
tion code that the slave doesn't support, the slave will send an error re-
sponse indicating that an ILLEGAL FUNCTION was received. The slave
will send a 3-byte error response with its identity, the function code
summed with 128, and the ILLEGAL FUNCTION error code.

For example, if slave 17 (0x11) receives a request for function 98 (0x62),
slave 17 will respond with identity 0x11, function code OxE2 (128+98),
and error code 0x01 (ILLEGAL FUNCTION):
