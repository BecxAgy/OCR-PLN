Conductivity at 25 ºC

Continuous sampling behind highly acid cation exchanger.
Depending on operating pressure.

In the event of alkaline operation, only with volatile alkalizers, conductivity in boiler water should not exceed 3 us/cm.

Hf continuous operation with demineralized water cannot be guaranteed, oxygen content should not exceed 0,02 ppm.
