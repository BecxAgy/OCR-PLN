Applying air pressure to Port 1 drives the pistons
outward, which turns the pinion counterclockwise as
the air volume on the outside of the pistons exhausts
through Port 2.

Applying air pressure to Port 2 drives the pistons
inward, which turns the pinion clockwise as the air
volume on the inside of the pistons exhausts through
Port 1.

Spring Return (Fail CW)

Applying air pressure to Port 1 drives the pistons
outward, which compresses the springs and turns
the pinion counterclockwise as the air volume on the
outside of the pistons exhausts through Port 2.

Exhausting the air pressure from Port 1 allows
stored energy of the springs to drive pistons inward,
turning the pinion clockwise. Air volume on outside
of pistons vents through Port 2.
