Returns

The valve shall be emptied, cleaned, and preserved before returning the equipment to the
manufacturer. The manufacturer will only open the returned equipment if the contamination

Disposal and recycling

At the end of the equipment service life, the relevant materials and parts should be recycled
or disposed of using local environmental regulation methods. If the product contains
substances which are harmful to the environment, then the removal or disposal of the

and/or gas in the “seal system” or utility.

(Add additional information if necessary. If the valve is not meant to recycle, remove all
references to recycling from this section.)

Refer to Safety Data Sheets and make sure that hazardous substances or toxic fluids are
disposed of safely and that the correct personal protective equipment is used. All activities
involving hazardous substances or toxic fluids must be in compliance with published safety
standards.
