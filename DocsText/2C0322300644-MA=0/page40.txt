Reassembly Procedures

1. Inspect all parts for wear and replace any worn parts
as needed. Replace all “O-rings.

2. Clean all components and lightly grease cylinder bore,
3. Remove the 16 Endcap Screws (11, 12). When pinion and seals per temperature rating notes. See
removing endcap screws on the supply side, apply low page 4.
heat to loosen. Failure to apply heat may result in
broken bolts. 3. Reverse the disassembly procedures to reassemble.
WARNING: Loaded Springe in Endeaps, should be 4. The standard Pinion (3) orientation is with the drive
+ pocket parallel with the Body (1) in the CW position.
4. SR - The Springs (21-24) will push the Endcaps off, re-

leasing the spring load prior to the disengagement of
the Endcap Screws (11, 12). Remove the Endcaps (2)
and Spring Cartridge (21-24).

DA- Remove the Endcaps (2). Step 6 will push the
Endcaps (2) from the Body (1).

. Remove the Right Piston (16) by pushing out through
inside of Body (1).

Changing Pinion Orientation

1. Disconnect all air and electrical supplies from actuator.

2. Remove all accessories from actuator and dismount
actuator from valve.

3. Remove the Pinion Snap Ring (7) and Pinion Washer

(6).
4. Tap Pinion (3) lightly with plastic mallet to remove.

5. Reverse Steps 3 & 4 with new Pinion (3) orientation.

. Rotate Pinion (3) counterclockwise (DA & SR-FCW) or
clockwise (DR & SR-FCCW) to drive the Pistons (16) off

Edo

When fitting the Pistons (16) ensure the teeth engage
the Pinion (3) at the same time by measuring in from
the edge of the Body (1) the same distance from each
end. Note: the orientation of the pistons will determine
the operation of the actuator. Refer to the diagrams
under “Operation” for correct piston position.

o

. When assembling a spring return actuator, stand
actuator cylinder vertical when inserting spring
cartridges. If this is not possible, make sure spring
cartridges are fully seated in piston pockets when
installing Endcap.

“

. Adjust the Stop Bolt (8) until the desired travel is
obtained and reinstall O-ring (10) and Nut (9).

oo

. Test the actuator for smooth operation and air leakage
at service pressure before reinstalling.

Changing Number of Springs

1. Follow the Disassembly Procedures through step 5.

o)

. Determine spring combination, consult catalog torque
charts, distributor or factory. Simply add or remove
one or more of the spring cartridges.

. Reassemble the actuator, paying special note to step 6
in reassembling procedures.
