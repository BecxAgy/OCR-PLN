Start-up

After the line has been flushed and pressure tested the valve is ready to operate.

In case of problem close the valves upstream and downstream, then depressurize the line in
which the valve is connected.

Valve Verification Before Start Up

1. Verify the tightness of the drain plug and of the vent valve.
2. Check the valve operability by stroking it to “full open” and “full close”.

Normal operation

The valves described in this manual have been designed to control flow for on/off service only,
so the valve working conditions are always fully open or fully closed.

Do not use the valve for flow control either in partly open or for throttling service to avoid
damage on the sealing surface.

To ensure longer life of the valve it is recommended to perform periodic checks and
maintenance operations.
