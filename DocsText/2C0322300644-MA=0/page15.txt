VB2 User Instruction — MO2-LSS ENG rev. 8

Cargoes bearing this symbol must be protected from excessive
humidity and must accordingly be stored under cover. If
particularly large or bulky packages cannot be stored in
warehouses or sheds, they must be carefully covered with
tarpaulins.

This symbol is intended to provide a clear indication of the
position of the center of gravity. To be meaningful, this symbol
should only be used where the center of gravity is not central.
The meaning is unambiguous if the symbol is applied onto two
upright surfaces at right angles to each other.

The absence of this symbol on packages amounts to permission
to use a hand truck on them.

The maximum stacking load must be stated as "... kg max”.
Since such marking is sensible only on packages with little
loading capacity, cargo bearing this symbol should be stowed
in the uppermost layer.

Stating that the package may be clamped at the indicated
point is logically equivalent to a prohibition of clamping
anywhere else.

According to regulations, the symbol should either be provided
with the suffix "...ºC" for a specific temperature or, in the case of
a temperature range, with an upper ("...ºC max.") and lower
(E...ºC min.”) temperature limit. The corresponding temperatures
or temperature limits should also be noted on the consignment
note.

This symbol should only be applied to the sides where the forklift
truck cannot be used. Absence of the symbol on other sides of
the package amounts to permission to use forklift trucks on these
sides.

Contact with packages bearing this symbol should be avoided
at low levels of relative humidity, especially if insulating footwear
is being worn or the ground/floor is nonconductive. Low levels
of relative humidity must in particular be expected on hot, dry
summer days and very cold winter days.
